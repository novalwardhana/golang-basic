It's nearly the New Year's Eve
I spend most my time with it
With a bock of resolutions
Sparks from the Christmas tree
And my baby, don't you see?
I'm here standing with a glee
The best New Year's Eve I've found with you

Whiskey one for me
And my love is for you
We don't even watch TV
Instead we're dancing by the sea

And my baby, don't you see?
I'm here standing with a glee
The best New Year's Eve I've found with you
Still the best New Year's Eve I've found with you
